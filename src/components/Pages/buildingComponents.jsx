                  Professional Learning Opportunities for Instructional Staff
                </span>
                For instructional staff to create nurturing learning experiences
                for students, they require continuous professional learning
                opportunities tailored to their specific needs and roles.
                Research has established that effective professional development
                for educators can improve student learning outcomes, with some
                studies showing gains of up to 21 percentile points. Teachers in
                the United States spend an average of 89 hours per year on
                professional development. However, many teachers reported
                feeling unsatisfied with the quality and relevance of the
                training they received.{" "}
                <a

                  className="text-blue-600"
                >
                  According to a survey conducted by the Bill and Melinda Gates
                  Foundation, only 29% of teachers were very satisfied with the
                  professional development they received.{" "}
                </a>
                This suggests a gap between the types of professional
                development opportunities offered and what teachers need to
                improve their effectiveness in the classroom. To address this
                issue, we ensure that our professional development offerings are
                grounded in research and are designed to be relevant,
                differentiated, engaging, and effective.

                  Leadership Support and Coaching
                </span>
                Leadership coaching for school administration is becoming
                increasingly important as schools face a range of complex
                challenges and shifting educational landscapes. To this end,
                school administrators require professional learning
                opportunities in leading equitable schools that ensure all
                students have access to high-quality education. This included
                meeting the needs of students with disabilities, leading schools
                to support diverse learners, equitably serving all students, and
                meeting the needs of English learners. Unfortunately, while the
                evidence points to the efficacy of coaching support for school
                administration, fewer than one quarter (23%) of principals
                reported having a mentor or coach in the past 2 yearsâ€”and this
                percentage was lower for principals in high-poverty schools
                (10%),{" "}
